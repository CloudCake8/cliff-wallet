## 6/6/25
Currently, i'm thinking of a hybrid design between a "bifold" wallet and something akin to a "ridge wallet". I think I want to keep the sheet metal design motifs of the ridge wallet (also for durability and RFID), while also having it fold open. I can use magnets to keep it closed. I'm not sure how I will hinge it, however. Maybe the plates sandwich some sort of fabric material?
